=====INSTALLATION:=====

Run the .exe, dumbass.

=====FEATURES:=====

Beating the piss out of Jon. Is this really that hard to comprehend?

=====HOW TO PLAY:=====

You start by fisting Jon, just like your dad to your mum.
Once you have some JCN (Joncoin), you can buy more weapons.

Unlock everything, and you win. It's just like real life!

=====A WORD FROM JUSTIN:=====

I challenged myself to make this game as quickly as possible.
